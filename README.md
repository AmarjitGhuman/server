AuthZForce Server provides a multi-tenant RESTful API to Policy Administration Points (PAP) and Policy Decision Points (PDP) as defined in the [OASIS XACML 3.0 standard](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/xacml-3.0-core-spec-os-en.html).

AuthZForce Server is also the Reference Implementation (GEri) of [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org) *Authorization PDP* Generic Enabler (GE). More info on the [FIWARE catalogue](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/authorization-pdp-authzforce).
The manuals are available as downloadable HTML/PDF from the [releases page](https://github.com/authzforce/server/releases/latest), or online on [readthedocs.org](http://authzforce-ce-fiware.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

*If you are interested in using an embedded XACML-compliant PDP in your Java applications, AuthZForce also provides a PDP engine as a Java library in [Authzforce core project](http://github.com/authzforce/core).*


## Features

### PDP (Policy Decision Point)
* Compliance with the following OASIS XACML 3.0 standards:
  * [XACML v3.0 Core standard](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/xacml-3.0-core-spec-os-en.html): all mandatory and optional features are supported, **except**: 
    * Elements `AttributesReferences`, `MultiRequests` and `RequestReference`;
    * Functions `urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:function:xpath-node-equal`, `urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:function:xpath-node-match` and `urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:function:access-permitted`;
    * [Algorithms planned for future deprecation](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/xacml-3.0-core-spec-os-en.html#_Toc325047257).
  * [XACML v3.0 Core and Hierarchical Role Based Access Control (RBAC) Profile Version 1.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/rbac/v1.0/xacml-3.0-rbac-v1.0.html)
  * [XACML v3.0 Multiple Decision Profile Version 1.0 - Repeated attribute categories](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/multiple/v1.0/cs02/xacml-3.0-multiple-v1.0-cs02.html#_Toc388943334)  (`urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:profile:multiple:repeated-attribute-categories`). 
  * Experimental support for:
    * [XACML Data Loss Prevention / Network Access Control (DLP/NAC) Profile Version 1.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/xacml-3.0-dlp-nac/v1.0/xacml-3.0-dlp-nac-v1.0.html): only `dnsName-value` datatype and `dnsName-value-equal` function are supported;
    * [XACML 3.0 Additional Combining Algorithms Profile Version 1.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/xacml-3.0-combalgs/v1.0/xacml-3.0-combalgs-v1.0.html): `on-permit-apply-second` policy combining algorithm;
    * [XACML v3.0 Multiple Decision Profile Version 1.0 - Requests for a combined decision](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/xacml-3.0-multiple-v1-spec-cd-03-en.html#_Toc260837890)  (`urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:profile:multiple:combined-decision`). 
* Detection of circular XACML policy references (PolicySetIdReference); 
* Control of the **maximum XACML PolicySetIdReference depth**;
* Control of the **maximum XACML VariableReference depth**;
* Optional **strict multivalued attribute parsing**: if enabled, multivalued attributes must be formed by grouping all `AttributeValue` elements in the same Attribute element (instead of duplicate Attribute elements); this does not fully comply with [XACML 3.0 Core specification of Multivalued attributes (ยง7.3.3)](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/xacml-3.0-core-spec-os-en.html#_Toc325047176), but it usually performs better than the default mode since it simplifies the parsing of attribute values in the request;
* Optional **strict attribute Issuer matching**: if enabled, `AttributeDesignators` without Issuer only match request Attributes without Issuer (and same AttributeId, Category...); this option is not fully compliant with XACML 3.0, ยง5.29, in the case that the Issuer is indeed not present on a AttributeDesignator; but it is the recommended option when all AttributeDesignators have an Issuer (the XACML 3.0 specification (5.29) says: *If the Issuer is not present in the attribute designator, then the matching of the attribute to the named attribute SHALL be governed by AttributeId and DataType attributes alone.*);
* Extensibility points:
  * **Attribute Datatypes**: you may extend the PDP engine with custom XACML attribute datatypes;
  * **Functions**: you may extend the PDP engine with custom XACML functions;
  * **Combining Algorithms**: you may extend the PDP engine with custom XACML policy/rule combining algorithms;
  * **Attribute Providers**: you may plug custom attribute providers into the PDP engine to allow it to retrieve attributes from other attribute sources (e.g. remote service) than the input XACML Request during evaluation; 
  * **Request Filter**: you may customize the processing of XACML Requests before evaluation by the PDP core engine (e.g. used for implementing [XACML v3.0 Multiple Decision Profile Version 1.0 - Repeated attribute categories](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/multiple/v1.0/cs02/xacml-3.0-multiple-v1.0-cs02.html#_Toc388943334));
  * **Result Filter**: you may customize the processing of XACML Results after evaluation by the PDP engine (e.g. used for implementing [XACML v3.0 Multiple Decision Profile Version 1.0 - Requests for a combined decision](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/xacml-3.0-multiple-v1-spec-cd-03-en.html#_Toc260837890));

### PAP (Policy Administration Point)
* Policy management: create/read/update/delete multiple policies and references from one to another (via PolicySetIdReference)
* Policy versioning: create/read/delete multiple versions per policy.
* Configurable root policy ID/version: top-level policy enforced by the PDP may be any managed policy (if no version defined in configuration, the latest available is selected)
* Configurable maximum number of policies;
* Configurable maximum number of versions per policy.
* Optional policy version rolling (when the maximum of versions per policy has been reached, oldest versions are automatically removed to make place).

### REST API
* Defined in standard [Web Application Description Language and XML schema](https://github.com/authzforce/rest-api-model/tree/develop/src/main/resources) so that you can automatically generate client code. 
* Provides access to all PAP/PDP features mentioned in previous sections.
* Multi-tenant: allows to have multiple domains/tenants, each with its own PAP/PDP, in particular its own policy repository.
* Conformance with [REST Profile of XACML v3.0 Version 1.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/xacml-rest/v1.0/xacml-rest-v1.0.html) 
* [Fast Infoset](http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/asn1/Pages/Fast-Infoset.aspx) support for requests/responses.

### High availability and load-balancing
* Integration with file synchronization tools (e.g. [csync2](http://oss.linbit.com/csync2/)) or distributed filesystems (e.g. NFS and CIFS) to build clusters of AuthZForce Servers. 


## Support
Use the *Issues* tab on the Github repository page.
Please include as much information as possible; the more we know, the better the chance of a quicker resolution:

* Software version
* Platform (OS and JDK)
* Stack traces generally really help! If in doubt include the whole thing; often exceptions get wrapped in other exceptions and the exception right near the bottom explains the actual error, not the first few lines at the top. It's very easy for us to skim-read past unnecessary parts of a stack trace.
* Log output can be useful too; sometimes enabling DEBUG logging can help;
* Your code & configuration files are often useful.

If you wish to contact the developers for other reasons, use [Authzforce contact mailing list](http://scr.im/azteam).

### Releasing
1. From the develop branch, prepare a release (example using a HTTP proxy):
<pre><code>
    $ mvn -Dhttps.proxyHost=proxyhostname -Dhttps.proxyPort=3128 jgitflow:release-start
</code></pre>
1. Update the CHANGELOG according to keepachangelog.com.
1. To perform the release (example using a HTTP proxy):
<pre><code>
    $ mvn -Dhttps.proxyHost=proxyhostname -Dhttps.proxyPort=3128 jgitflow:release-finish
</code></pre>
    If, after deployment, the command does not succeed because of some issue with the branches. Fix the issue, then re-run the same command but with 'noDeploy' option set to true to avoid re-deployment:
<pre><code>
    $ mvn -Dhttps.proxyHost=proxyhostname -Dhttps.proxyPort=3128 -DnoDeploy=true jgitflow:release-finish
</code></pre>
  More info on jgitflow: http://jgitflow.bitbucket.org/
